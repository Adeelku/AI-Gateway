# APIM ‚ù§Ô∏è OpenAI

The rapid pace of AI advances demands experimentation-driven approaches for organizations to remain at the forefront of the industry. With AI steadily becoming a game-changer for an array of sectors, maintaining a fast-paced innovation trajectory is crucial for businesses aiming to leverage its full potential. 

__AI services__ are predominantly accessed via __APIs__, underscoring the essential need for a robust and efficient API management strategy. This strategy is instrumental for maintaining control and governance over the consumption of __AI services__.

With the expanding horizons of __AI services__ and their seamless integration with __APIs__, there is a considerable demand for a comprehensive __AI Gateway__ concept, which broadens the core principles of API management. Aiming to accelerate the experimentation of advanced use cases and pave the road for further innovation in this rapidly evolving field. The well-architected principles of the __AI Gateway__ provides a framework for the confident deployment of __Intelligent Apps__ into production..

## AI Gateway
![AI-Gateway flow](images/ai-gateway.gif)

This repo explores the __AI Gateway__ concept through a series of experimental labs. [Azure API Management](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/api-management-key-concepts) plays a crucial role within these labs, handling AI services APIs, with security, reliability, performance, overall operational efficiency and cost controls. The primary focus is on [Azure OpenAI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/overview), which sets the standard reference for Large Language Models (LLM). However, the same principles could potentially be applied to any LLM.

## üß™ Labs

Acknowledging the rising dominance of Python, particularly in the realm of AI, along with the powerful experimental capabilities of Jupyter notebooks, the following labs are structured around Jupyter notebooks, with step-by-step instructions with Python scripts, Bicep files and APIM policies:

## ü™û Mock Server

The AI-Gateway Mock server is designed to mimic the behavior and responses of the OpenAI API, thereby creating an efficient simulation environment suitable for testing and development purposes on the integration with APIM and other use cases.
The [app.py](app.py) can be customized to tailor the Mock server to specific use cases.

# APIM ‚ù§Ô∏è OpenAI

## Vector Searching lab
![flow](../../images/vector-searching.gif)

Playground to try Azure AI Search integrated vectorization and Azure OpenAI embeddings. Integrated vectorization takes a dependency on indexers and skillsets, using the Text Split skill for data chunking, and the AzureOpenAIEmbedding skill.
Reuses the [Azure AI Search integrated vectorization sample](https://github.com/Azure/azure-search-vector-samples/blob/main/demo-python/code/integrated-vectorization/azure-search-integrated-vectorization-sample.ipynb).

### Prerequisites
- [Python 3.8 or later version](https://www.python.org/) installed
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) installed with the [Jupyter notebook extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter) enabled
- [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) installed
- [An Azure Subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/) with Contributor permissions
- [Access granted to Azure OpenAI](https://aka.ms/oai/access) or just enable the mock service
- [Sign in to Azure with Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/authenticate-azure-cli-interactively)

### üöÄ Get started
Proceed by opening the [Jupyter notebook](backend-pool-load-balancing.ipynb), and follow the steps provided.

### üóëÔ∏è Clean up resources
When you're finished with the lab, you should remove all your deployed resources from Azure to avoid extra charges and keep your Azure subscription uncluttered.
Use the [clean-up-resources notebook](clean-up-resources.ipynb) for that.
